            [Verse 1]<br />
            Used to cry 'bout some crazy sh*t before<br />
            I used to feel so obligated to be so much more<br />
            I used to let some people tell me how to live and what to be<br />
            But if I can't be me, the f*ck's the point?<br />
            Noâ€¦
          </p>
          <p>
            [Chorus]<br />
            I don't care about it anymore, oh<br />
            I don't care about it anymore
          </p>
          <p>
            [Verse 2]<br />
            Now I laugh about the things that used to be important to me<br />
            Used to have a hold on me, used to have a hold on me<br />
            Like what do you think, and what he thinks, and what they think<br />
            But I love me, yeah
          </p>
          <p>
            [Chorus]<br />
            I don't care about it anymore, oh<br />
            I don't care about it anymore
          </p>
          <p>
            [Outro]<br />
            Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh, yeah, uh<br />
            I-I-I, ooh-ooh, uh<br />
            I-I don't care about it anymore<br />
            I-I don't care about it anymore
