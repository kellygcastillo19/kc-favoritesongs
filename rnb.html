            [Verse 1]<br />
            Had a lot of space, nothin' in the way<br />
            I was movin' 'round like everywhere<br />
            Had a couple flings, didn't mean a thing<br />
            'Cause I'm not the type to really care<br />
            Till you came around my heart<br />
            Say you been workin' hard for my attention, for a minute<br />
            I never felt so soft, you throw my decisions off
          </p>
          <p>
            [Pre-Chorus]<br />
            Yeah, I see you tryin'real hard and that's good enough<br />
            Spend a little more time, so that's good enough<br />
            Now you all on my mind and that's good enough<br />
            For me, for me<br />
            Not an easy read, I'm sure<br />
            I'm not the typical girl<br />
            And I know I make it hard, but I see you tryin'<br />
            When I look into your eyes, I just can't deny it
          </p>
          <p>
            [Chorus]<br />
            You got that something I always wanted<br />
            Usually not my type, but I still want it<br />
            Boy, you got that something to wake me up in the mornin'<br />
            Love is on my appetite<br />
            No, you don't wanna waste my time<br />
            I see you tryin', I see you tryin'
          </p>
          <p>
            [Verse 2]<br />
            I see you tryin'<br />
            They always say to wait for the perfect timin'<br />
            I tried to cut you off, but you wasn't buyin'<br />
            You messin' up my plans, I was tryna fight it, oh, yeah<br />
            I made you wait<br />
            You never had a girl put you in your place<br />
            Pain ain't on my heart, I just wanna say<br />
            You cut the chase, I can't escape
          </p>
          <p>
            [Pre-Chorus]<br />
            Yeah, I see you tryin' real hard and that's good enough<br />
            Spend a little more time, so that's good enough<br />
            Now you all on my mind and that's good enough<br />
            For me, for me<br />
            Not an easy read, I'm sure<br />
            I'm not the typical girl<br />
            And I know I make it hard, but I see you tryin'<br />
            When I look into your eyes, I just can't deny it

            [Chorus]<br />
            You got that something I always wanted<br />

          </p>
          <p>
            [Bridge]<br />
            Truth is, I'm down<br />
            You ain't been in love<br />
            But you're learnin' how I need you now<br />
            Kind of feel weird 'cause you're not so comfortable sharin' your
            feelings<br />
            Ooh, I commend you<br />
            You're really winnin'<br />
            You got my attention, no competition, yeah, yeah
          </p>
          <p>
            [Chorus]<br />
            You got that something I always wanted (I wanted)<br />
            Usually not my type, but I still want it (I want it)<br />
            Boy, you got that something to wake me up in the mornin' (Wake me
            up, wake me up, yeah, yeah)<br />
            Love is on my appetite (Appetite)<br />
            No, you don't wanna waste my time (No, you don't)<br />
            I see you tryin', I see you tryin'
          </p>
          <p>
            [Outro]<br />
            I see you tryin', I see you tryin'<br />

            [Verse 1]<br />
            I could drop sixty on this bag<br />
            Just to hold me for the rest of the week<br />
            I could drop sixty on this bag<br />
            I just hope that I got something to eat<br />
            I could drop sixty on this bag<br />
            Just to hold me for the rest of the week<br />
            I could drop sixty on this bag
          </p>
          <p>
            [Verse 2]<br />
            I could drop forty on that bag<br />
            'Cause I gotta get a gift for my girl<br />
            I could drop forty on that bag<br />
            But it's all my money left in the world<br />
            I could drop forty on that bag<br />
            But it's all my money left in the world<br />
            I could drop forty on that bag
          </p>
          <p>
            [Verse 3]<br />
            I could drop twenty on that bag<br />
            But that ain't even going to do<br />
            I could drop twenty on that bag<br />
            And I could kick it for an hour or two<br />
            I could drop twenty on that bag<br />
            As if there's something better to do<br />
            So I'mma drop sixty on this bag
