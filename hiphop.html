          <p>
            [Verse 1]<br />
            Anything you're saying to me right now<br />
            Probably have the right to say<br />
            Any crazy things you're feeling for me tonight<br />
            You can get it on out the way
          </p>
          <p>
            [Pre-Chorus]<br />
            'Cause I ain't been the best that I coulda been<br />
            I ain't do the sh*t that I shoulda did<br />
            But every time I come crawlin' on my knees<br />
            You're there
          </p>
          <p>
            [Chorus]<br />
            And you just keep on takin' me back<br />
            And I don't know why you do<br />
            'Cause I'm no good to you<br />
            And you just keep on takin' me back<br />
            In your open arms, baby, I belong<br />
            And you just keep on takin'
          </p>
          <p>
            [Verse 2]<br />
            You can yell and you can curse and call me a b*tch<br />
            Probably have the right to do<br />
            You can tell the world that I'm a narcissist<br />
            I would think they'd listen to you
          </p>
          <p>
            [Pre-Chorus]<br />
            'Cause I ain't been the best that I coulda been<br />
            I ain't do the sh*t that I shoulda did<br />
            But every time I come crawlin' on my knees<br />
            You're there

            And you just keep on takin' me back<br />
            And I don't know why you do<br />
            'Cause I'm no good to you<br />
            And you just keep on takin' me back<br />
            In your open arms, baby, I belong<br />
            And you just keep on takin'
          </p>
          <p>
            [Post-Chorus]<br />
            Me back, and I don't know why you do<br />
            'Cause I'm no good to you<br />
            And you just keep on takin' me back<br />
            In your open arms, baby, I belong<br />

            [Chorus 1: Chance the Rapper]<br />
            Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank<br />
            I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank<br />
            I miss my cocoa butter kisses<br />
            I miss my cocoa butter kisses<br />
            Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank<br />

            [Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]<br />
            Okie dokie,alkie, keep it low-key like Thor lil' bro<br />
            Or he'll go blow the loudy, saudy of sour Saudi<br />
            Wiley up off peyote, wilin' like that coyote<br />
            If I sip any Henny, my belly just might be outie<br />
            Pull up inside a huggy, Starsky and Hutch a dougie<br />
            I just opened up the pack, in an hour I'll ash my lucky<br />
            Tonight she just yelling "F*ck me"<br />
            Two weeks she'll be yelling "F*ck me"<br />
            Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie<br />
            And Chuck E. Cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me<br />
            Put Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me<br />
            Oh, generation above me, I know you still remember me<br />
            My afro look just like daddy's, y'all taught me how to go hunting,
            blam
          </p>
          <p>
            [Chorus 1: Chance the Rapper]<br />
            Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank<br />
            I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank<br />
            I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)<br />
            I miss my cocoa butter kisses<br />
            Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank (Innanet)<br />

            [Verse 2: Vic Mensa]<br />
            I will smoke a little something but I don't inhale<br />
            Everywhere that I go, everywhere, they be asking how's it going<br />
            Say the going's well, go figure, Victor's light skinned<br />
            Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell, all praise to the God<br />
            God knows he's a pro, he's a pro like COINTEL<br />
            Check, checkmate, check me, take me to the bedroom<br />
            Like she know me well, I mean normally<br />
            You see Norma Jean wouldn't kick it with Farmer Phil<br />
            But these kids these days, they get so high<br />
            Burn trees, smoke chlorophyll, 'til they can't feel sh*t<br />
            Sh*t-faced, faced it, 15 hits on this L<br />
            Elevated, train, and the craziest thing<br />
            Got me feeling like Lauryn Hill, miseducated, my d*ck delegated<br />
            Rap Bill Bellamy, they said I shoulda never made it<br />
            Probably shoulda been dead or in jail<br />
            Deadbeat dad,enough of that jazz<br />
            Assh*le, absinthe, thumpin' that glass<br />
            Are we there yet?<br />
            Ice cubes in a bong<br />
            Rip, brain-dead, take a tug and then pass
          </p>
          <p>
            [Bridge: Vic Mensa]<br />
            I think we all addicted<br />
            Yeah, I think we all addicted<br />
            Really though, I think we all addicted (Yah)<br />
            I think we all addicted
          </p>
          <p>
            [Chorus 2: Vic Mensa]<br />
            Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank<br />
            I got burn holes in my memories, my homies think it's dank<br />
            I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)<br />
            I think we all addicted (Kisses, kisses)
          </p>

            I miss my cocoa butter kisses
          </p>
          <p>
            [Verse 3: Twista]<br />
            I could make a flow, pitter patter with a patter pitter, juicy<br />
            Used to be in a jalabiya and a kufi<br />
            Trying hard not to be addicted to a groupie<br />
            I ended up on an album cover in a Coogi<br />You see, I be still a
            God but a goofy<br />You be flowing about drugs and a Uzi<br />
            That's the dual principle, sometimes I'ma be about some h*es<br />Sometimes
            I'ma wanna make a movie<br />And when it come to rapping fast, I'm
            the Higgs Boson (Yeah)<br />And though my style freakish I could
            still break your body down to five pieces like I did Voltron<br />
            'Cause I'm addicted to the craft and I be off a OG<br />
            Know me, I'm the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the dope, see (What?)<br />
            Never scared of mean spirits, methamphetamine lyrics<br />
            Cooler like I'm off of codeine, low key<br />
            Don't be so judgmental, even though I'm reminiscing<br />
            If I don't know what I miss is<br />
            I'ma end up figuring out that it's home<br />
            And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses<br />
            This is just a testament to the ones that raised me<br />
            The ones that I praise and I'm thanking<br />
            I need 'em but the chronic all up in my clothes<br />
            And I wanna get a hug, and I can't 'cause I'm stanking<br />
            Never too old for a spanking, IGH!
          </p>
          <p>
            [Chorus 2: Vic Mensa]<br />
            Cigarettes on cigarettes, my momma think I stank<br />
            I got burn holes in my memories, my homies think it's dank<br />
